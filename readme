# DevOps Assignment – Docker + Git + Linux

## 1. Five DevOps Concepts

### *1. Continuous Integration (CI)*
A practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository, improving code stability and enabling automated testing.

### *2. Continuous Delivery (CD)*
An automated pipeline that ensures every code change is production-ready and deployable at any given moment.

### *3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)*
Infrastructure provisioning using code instead of manual configuration, enabling consistent, repeatable environments.

### *4. Containerization*
Using containers to package applications with dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across environments.

### *5. Monitoring & Logging*
Collecting system and application metrics to identify issues, support troubleshooting, and maintain performance visibility.

## 2. How the Assignment Would Be Completed

Although Docker is not installed locally, the typical end-to-end workflow is outlined below.

### *Step A — Create a Dockerfile*
Write a Dockerfile that installs Linux utilities and runs basic commands.

### *Step B — Build the Docker Image (normally)*
```bash
docker build -t basic-linux-ops .
