## 1. DevOps Concepts

### *1. Continuous Integration (CI)*
CI is the practice of frequently integrating code into a shared repository. Automated builds and tests run after each change to improve stability and reduce integration issues.

### *2. Continuous Delivery (CD)*
CD ensures that every code change is automatically tested, validated, and ready for deployment. This improves software reliability and shortens release cycles.

### *3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)*
IaC manages and provisions infrastructure using code instead of manual setups. It improves consistency, enables automation, and allows version-controlled infrastructure.

### *4. Containerization*
Containerization packages an application and all its dependencies into a standardized unit. Docker containers ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

### *5. Monitoring & Logging*
Monitoring collects system and application metrics, while logging captures runtime events. Together, they support performance insights, troubleshooting, and operational reliability.

## 2. How This Assignment Would Normally Be Completed

Below is the end-to-end workflow for building and running the Docker container.  
Due to environment limitations (Docker not installed locally), the commands are documented for understanding but not executed in this environment.

### *Step A – Create the Dockerfile*
A Dockerfile was written to:
- Use Ubuntu as the base image  
- Install Linux tools (curl, wget, vim, git, tree, ping)  
- Generate a script demonstrating Linux commands  
- Execute that script using the CMD instruction  

### *Step B – Build the Docker Image (Normally Done in Terminal)*

```bash
docker build -t basic-linux-ops
